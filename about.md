# About

Developer. Growing through documenting and reflecting.

This blog is my personal space — a place to organize my thoughts, record what I learn, and look back on the path I’ve taken.

Code, books, music, investing, games. I write freely about whatever interests me.

If someone happens to find something helpful here, that’s a nice bonus.
