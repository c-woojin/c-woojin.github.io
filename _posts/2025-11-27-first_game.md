# My First Unity Game: Rocket 🚀

I recently finished my first Unity game — a tiny 1-minute WebGL project called Rocket.
It’s simple, built while following a Udemy course, and definitely not a “big” game by any stretch.
But it is the first game I actually finished, shared, and received real feedback on.
And that alone makes it meaningful.

This post is a short and honest retrospective on that experience.

## What Kind of Game Is Rocket?

Rocket is a simple 2.5D mini-game made with 3D assets, focused on balancing thrust and gravity to reach the landing zone.

It’s minimal, a bit clumsy, occasionally frustrating (by design, I guess), and surprisingly fun to watch others attempt.

## Built From a Udemy Course

The entire project comes from the Udemy course:
[Complete C# Unity 2D Game Development (Updated To Unity 6)](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wjs3@c5ykY3y-gFhfyTz4PE3H17salOpl1sb0pi162VtWKndkUxYuiZtgF5mK8-Rkb7sSQg==/)

Following the course gave me a guided way into Unity’s ecosystem:
	•	Component-based design
	•	Rigidbody and collisions
	•	Basic physics interactions
	•	Update vs FixedUpdate
	•	Debugging through the Inspector

Nothing fancy — but for a beginner, every small concept felt new and occasionally overwhelming.

While it started as simple “follow along,” at some point it shifted into understanding how Unity actually works under the hood.

## Challenge #1 — Level Design Is Harder Than It Looks

Designing even a tiny level was way more difficult than I expected.

Moving an obstacle by just 1 meter could make the game either:
	•	too easy,
	•	impossible, or
	•	mildly infuriating (which my friends kindly pointed out).

I realized level design isn’t about placing objects — it’s about shaping the player experience.
That was a meaningful lesson tucked inside a tiny project.

## Challenge #2 — Getting Comfortable with Unity’s Framework

Unity’s ecosystem was a lot to take in at first:
	•	Physics values behaving unexpectedly
	•	Components interacting in non-obvious ways
	•	Inspector tweaks drastically changing gameplay
	•	Confusion between script execution orders

Even for a small game, Unity forces you to think systematically.
It was frustrating at times, but also the exact kind of friction that leads to actual learning.

## The Best Moment: Sharing It with My Family

The most memorable part of this project wasn’t the development itself — it was sharing the game with my mom and my younger brother.

Their reactions were simple but surprisingly meaningful:
	•	“You made this? That’s impressive.”
	•	“Why is landing so difficult?”
	•	“This game is kind of annoying… but in a fun way.”

It didn’t matter that the game was tiny or built from a course.
Watching my own family play something I created — and react to it in real time — made the whole thing feel real.

The game was small.
But it was mine, and they played it.
That was enough.

## What This Small Project Left Me With

Rocket is a tiny game, but it left me with tangible lessons:
	•	Finishing something, even a small project, builds confidence
	•	Implementation teaches more than theory ever can
	•	Sharing your work is part of the creative process
	•	Small, repeatable completions accelerate growth much faster than big, unfinished ideas

This project chipped away at the fear of “starting game development.”
Next time, I want to build something slightly more original — still small, still simple, but fully mine.

## What’s Next

Nothing huge.
Just another tiny game — this time with my own design choices and a few more mechanics layered in.

Rocket wasn’t big, but it was a clean first step.
And a good first step is all I needed.

## Play the Game

If you want to try the tiny project yourself, you can play it here:

It’s short, simple, and occasionally frustrating — which is exactly how I intended it.
